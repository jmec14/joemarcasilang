= WHAT OTHERS ARE SAYING =

"I switched from IDX Broker. I get more voluntary sign ups than I did with old provider. I think that speaks for itself."

"No solution even compares with what Showcase IDX offer. There is no way I would steer clients towards any other solution."

"I have used both Diverse Solutions and IhomeFinder. Neither delivered what I wanted. Since switching to Showcase, my bounce rate is down 20%, time spent on my site has doubled, and most importantly I am getting 4x more registrations on my site."

"No subdomains or Iframes is probably my favorite feature, but at the end of the day it's about Results. I think the biggest thing is how "sticky" their site becomes. With Showcase IDX, the retention rate is much higher."

"An IDX Feed That's Above The Rest! Showcase IDX is a better solution in regards to search rankings. I love the hot sheets and the simplicity to create "hot sheets" for different areas."

"Best IDX plugin by far! Showcase IDX is now the only IDX I recommend to my clients. Visually, it is stunning and so much better than the other IDX’s. To top it off, customer service is top notch"

"Best IDX Solution out there. No solution even compares with what Showcase IDX offer. There is no way I would steer clients towards any other solution." 

"Best WordPress IDX, period. Simple to use (i.e. low bounce rates and high user engagement), great mapping with polygon search, fantastic mobile responsive functionality, ‘login with facebook’, ultra-fast, and they are always adding or updating functionalities."

"Converts website leads at a high level. Showcase IDX is leading the way in the world of WordPress IDX solutions. Clients love utilizing the Showcase IDX product with original features not found in any other product."

"by far the best IDX solution out there. Forward thinking, always improving, with a clear focus on the interface - one of the major areas other providers fail. It feels like everyone else is still playing catch-up all these years later."
